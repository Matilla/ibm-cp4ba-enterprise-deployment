You need to get rid of the One-shot deployment at first. You can use the following remove Job. And then remove whole apollo-one-shot Project.
```yaml
apiVersion: batch/v1
kind: Job
metadata:
  generateName: apollo-one-shot-remove-
  namespace: apollo-one-shot
spec:
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: apollo-one-shot  
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: apollo-one-shot
          image: ubi9/ubi:9.0.0
          command: ["/bin/bash"]
          args:
            ["-c","cd /usr; yum install git -y && git clone --depth 1 --shallow-submodules --progress --branch ${GIT_BRANCH} ${GIT_REPOSITORY}; cd ./ibm-cp4ba-enterprise-deployment/scripts; chmod u+x apollo-one-shot.sh; ./apollo-one-shot.sh"]
          imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
          env:
            - name: ACTION

```

Apollo one-shot like deployment from OpenShift console based on https://ibm.github.io/cloud-pak-deployer/50-advanced/run-on-openshift/run-deployer-on-openshift-using-console/

### 1. Create new Project

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Namespace
metadata:
  creationTimestamp: null
  name: cloud-pak-deployer
```

### 2. Assign permissions

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ServiceAccount
metadata:
  name: cloud-pak-deployer-sa
  namespace: cloud-pak-deployer
---
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: RoleBinding
metadata:
  name: system:openshift:scc:privileged
  namespace: cloud-pak-deployer
roleRef:
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
  kind: ClusterRole
  name: system:openshift:scc:privileged
subjects:
- kind: ServiceAccount
  name: cloud-pak-deployer-sa
  namespace: cloud-pak-deployer
---
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: ClusterRoleBinding
metadata:
  name: cloud-pak-deployer-cluster-admin
roleRef:
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
  kind: ClusterRole
  name: cluster-admin
subjects:
- kind: ServiceAccount
  name: cloud-pak-deployer-sa
  namespace: cloud-pak-deployer
```

### 3. Add configuration

Customize
- `TODO_RWX_FILE_STORAGE_CLASS` - RFX File Storage class for PVC where the deployer stores its runtime data
- `TODO_ICR_PASSWORD` - password for IBM Container Registry from https://myibm.ibm.com/products-services/containerlibrary
- `TODO_UNIVERSAL_PASSWORD` - Password which will be used for all user credentials in the deployment
- `TODO_OCP_VERSION` - your OpenShift version, only x.y like 4.10, 4.11, 4.12

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: cloud-pak-deployer-status
  namespace: cloud-pak-deployer
spec:
  accessModes:
  - ReadWriteMany
  resources:
